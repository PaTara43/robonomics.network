  "Your apartment is the most intimate place. It’s unlikely that you would be comfortable knowing that all your data ends up on a server somewhere outside your home. In this project, each apartment is equipped with a home server with Home Assistant.": "您的公寓是最亲密的地方。您可能不会舒服地知道您的所有数据都会存储在家外的某个服务器上。在这个项目中，每个公寓都配备了一个带有Home Assistant的家庭服务器。",
  "Hello everyone!": "大家好！",
  "My name is Vadim Manaenko. I am a co-founder of Pinout LTD and one of the key developers in the [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/) project. Today I want to share with you big news: Pinout LTD has signed a contract with the developer [CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/) for the automation of 28 apartments and common area in the [Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28) building. Work will begin in 2024.": "我的名字是Vadim Manaenko。我是Pinout LTD的联合创始人，也是[Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/)项目的主要开发人员之一。今天我想与大家分享一个重大消息：Pinout LTD已与开发商[CCS](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/)签订了一份合同，用于自动化[Residence 28](https://www.stylianidesgroup.com/property/residence-28)楼内的28个公寓和公共区域。工作将于2024年开始。",
  "About the Project": "关于项目",
  "The developer CCS has been operating on the market since 1997 and has built more than 600 properties. The Residence 28 project is located in Limassol, Cyprus. The building will consist of two blocks with a total living area (covered part) of about 1800 m2. This will be the first apartment building in Cyprus with a smart home system built on Zigbee wireless devices controlled by the open source [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) software, remote access will be provided via the Robonomics Parachain Web3 cloud.": "开发商CCS自1997年以来一直在市场上运营，并建造了600多个物业。Residence 28项目位于塞浦路斯利马索尔。该建筑将由两个楼块组成，总建筑面积（覆盖部分）约为1800平方米。这将是塞浦路斯第一座采用由开源软件[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)控制的Zigbee无线设备构建的智能家居系统的公寓楼，远程���问将通过Robonomics Parachain Web3云提供。",
  "What Will Future Residents Receive?": "未来的居民将获得什么？",
  "Below is a floor plan of one of the two blocks and a designation legend.": "下面是两个楼块之一的楼层平面图和指示图例。",
  "Don't be confused by the word \"Wired\". This means that the device requires constant power, while the devices in the “Wireless” column are battery operated.": "不要被“有线”一词所困惑。这意味着设备需要持续供电，而“无线”列中的设备是电池供电的。",
  "What new will the installation of all these devices bring to apartments?": "安装所有这些设备会给公寓带来什么新的东西？",
  "Smart switches will allow residents to control lighting both in the usual way and through a smartphone application, set up schedules and scenarios. For example, while in the bedroom, you can turn off the lights in the entire apartment or create the atmosphere for the evening with a defined scene.": "智能开关将允许居民通过智能手机应用程序控制照明，设置时间表和场景。例如，在卧室中，您可以关闭整个公寓的灯光或创建定义的场景来营造夜晚的氛围。",
  "Programmable IR remote controls can handle multiple devices from one location. For example, turning on the air conditioner on a schedule or to maintain a set temperature in the room.": "可编程的红外遥控器可以从一个位置控制多个设备。例如，按计划打开空调或保持房间的设定温度。",
  "Curtains can be tied to your alarm clock to make waking up a more pleasant experience.": "窗帘可以与您的闹钟绑定，使您的起床体验更加愉快。",
  "A smart boiler button will allow you to set the schedule once and no longer think about hot water in the winter.": "智能锅炉按钮将允许您设置一次时间表，不再考虑冬天的热水问题。",
  "Various sensors will give you complete information about the place where you live. Are all your doors and windows closed, what is the temperature and humidity in the nursery, how much electricity do you consume and for what, is there a water leak somewhere.": "各种传感器将为您提供有关您居住地的完整信息。您的所有门窗是否关闭，托儿所的温度和湿度如何，您消耗了多少电力以及用于什么，是否有水泄漏等。",
  "For greater comfort for residents, Pinout engineers will create seamless Internet within the apartment so that you have no dead zones.": "为了给居民提供更大的舒适度，Pinout工程师将在公寓内创建无缝的互联网，以便您没有死角。",
  "Common Area": "公共区域",
  "The building would not be called smart if the matter was limited only to automation inside the apartment. In a common area, smart relays will monitor the time of sunrise and sunset in order to turn on street lighting when it is really needed, without wasting resources. Lights in the lobby and staircases will turn on only when movement is detected.": "如果仅限于公寓内的自动化，该建筑将无法称为智能。在公共区域，智能继电器将监控日出和日���时间，以便在真正需要时打开街道照明，而不浪费资源。大堂和楼梯间的灯光只有在检测到运动时才会打开。",
  "Regarding security, residents will have access to the intercom system from a single home control panel. We will also install CCTV cameras for security.": "关于安全性，居民将可以从单一的家庭控制面板访问对讲系统。我们还将安装闭路电视摄像头进行安全监控。",
  "Conclusion": "结论",
  "Do you have the feeling that all this has already happened somewhere? Smart houses and apartments have been built for decades. So what new are Pinout engineers doing?": "您是否有一种这一切已经在某个地方发生过的感觉？智能房屋和公寓已经建造了几十年。那么Pinout工程师在做什么新的事情呢？",
  "Your apartment is the most intimate place. It’s unlikely that you would be comfortable knowing that all your data ends up on a server somewhere outside your home. In this project, each apartment is equipped with a home server with Home Assistant. This software allows you to combine all devices into a single system, and all data will remain inside your apartment.": "您的公寓是最亲密的地方。您可能不会舒服地知道您的所有数据都会存储在家外的某个服务器上。在这个项目中，每个公寓都配备了一个带有Home Assistant的家庭服务器。这个软件可以将所有设备组合成一个系统，所有数据都将保留在您的公寓内。",
  "This way we get rid of delays in transmitting commands over the global Internet. If I’m at home and press “turn off the lights,” there’s no point in sending a signal somewhere and waiting for a response.": "这样，我们就摆脱了通过全球互联网传输命令的延迟。如果我在家里按下“关闭灯光”按钮，发送信号并等待响应就没有意义了。",
  "Moreover, Home Assistant itself will understand that a new smart device has appeared, for example, a TV or a robot vacuum cleaner, and will offer to add it. You yourself can expand the smart home system and customize automation to suit your habits.": "此外，Home Assistant本身将了解到新的智能设备的出现，例如电视或机器人吸尘器，并提供添加的选项。您自己可以扩展智能家居系统并根据自己的习惯进行自定义自动化。",
  "Residence 28 is not just a new residential complex with automation. This is a smart home that easily adapts to your life.": "Residence 28不仅是一个带有自动化的新住宅综合体。这是一个可以轻松适应您生活的智能家居。"
