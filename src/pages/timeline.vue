          <div class="hyphens">
            <p>We continue to work with developing the Robonomics platform over Ethereum and Polkadot networks as universal L2 solution for Robot-as-a-Service/IoT nodes. There are more releases on GitHub and new cool tech under armor. We invite developers to our community to spread web3+robotics. Besides the community is welcome to participate in our project life from spring 2020 due to Aragon DAO.</p>

          <div class="hyphens">
            <p>By November 2018, Airalab had alfa version of the Robonomics network running in Ethereum mainnet. Also we published on GitHub a set of tools for creating projects in the Robot-as-a-Service format and decentralized applications or serverless applications to work with the network.</p>

          <div class="hyphens">
            <p>The IoT market is only growing up, which means that for connecting robots there is a huge opportunity to use web3 technologies straight away to organize human-to-machine and m2m communication. Cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, sovereign identification can be a strong driver for the development of Robot-as-a-Service around the world.</p>

            <p>We formed a common concept for creating a decentralized network of providers for servicing Smart cities â€” the Robonomics network.</p>

          <div class="hyphens">
            <p>We identified a range of tasks, in which p2p technologies have capabilities that were not previously available for robotics, such as money for robots and smart contracts. These are examples of Robot-as-a-Service under decentralized computer control, i.e. economic agents on digital markets. That was our common vision of the next 4 years in work.</p>
